# AI Interview Assistant

## Overview

The AI Interview Assistant is a sophisticated real-time interview platform that leverages artificial intelligence to conduct professional technical interviews. This system provides an automated, scalable solution for organizations seeking to streamline their interview processes while maintaining consistency and quality in candidate evaluation.

## Project Description

This platform enables candidates to engage in natural voice conversations with an AI interviewer that can ask technical questions, analyze responses, and provide follow-up inquiries based on the candidate's answers. The system operates entirely through web browsers, eliminating the need for additional software installations while providing real-time audio visualization and feedback.

## Core Functionality

The AI Interview Assistant addresses several key challenges in modern recruitment:

**Scalability**: The system can conduct multiple simultaneous interviews without human intervention, significantly reducing the time and resources required for initial candidate screening.

**Consistency**: Every candidate receives the same standardized interview experience, eliminating variability that can occur with different human interviewers.

**Accessibility**: Candidates can participate in interviews from any location with internet access, removing geographical barriers and scheduling constraints.

**Real-time Processing**: The platform provides immediate responses and natural conversation flow, creating an engaging interview experience that closely mimics human interaction.
